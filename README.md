# **Beijing Air Quality Forecasting**

## **Project Overview**

This project is part of the Machine Learning Techniques I course and focuses on forecasting PM2.5 air pollution levels in Beijing using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Accurate predictions of PM2.5 concentrations help policymakers and communities take timely action to mitigate air pollution effects.
